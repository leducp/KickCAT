# A simple C++ EtherCAT master/slave stack.

Kick-start your slaves!

Thin EtherCAT stack designed to be embedded in a more complex software and with efficiency in mind.

## Master stack

### Current state:
 - Can go to OP state
 - Can read and write PI
 - interface redundancy is supported
 - CoE: read and write SDO - blocking and async call
 - CoE: Emergency message
 - Bus diagnostic: can reset and get errors counters
 - hook to configure non compliant slaves
 - consecutives writes to reduce latency - up to 255 datagrams in flight
 - build for Linux and PikeOS

**NOTE** The current implementation is designed for little endian host only!

### TODO:
 - CoE: segmented transfer - partial implementation
 - CoE: diagnosis message - 0x10F3
 - Bus diagnostic: auto discover broken wire (on top of error counters)
 - More profiles: FoE, EoE, AoE, SoE
 - Distributed clock
 - AF_XDP Linux socket to improve performance
 - Addressing groups

### Operatings systems:
#### Linux
To improve latency on Linux, you have to
 - use Linux RT (PREMPT_RT patches),
 - set a real time scheduler for the program (i.e. with chrt)
 - disable NIC IRQ coalescing (with ethtool)
 - disable RT throttling
 - isolate ethercat task and network IRQ on a dedicated core
 - change network IRQ priority

#### PikeOS
 - Tested on PikeOS 5.1 for native personnality (p4ext)
 - You have to provide the CMake cross-toolchain file which shall define PIKEOS variable (or adapt the main CMakelists.txt to your needs)
 - examples are provided with a working but non-optimal process/thread configuration (examples/PikeOS/p4ext_config.c): feel free to adapt it to your needs

### Build:
KickCAT project is handled through CMake. To build the project, call CMake to configure it and then the build tool (default on Linux is make):
  1. Configure the project (more information on https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/)
  ```
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  ```
  2. Build the project
  ```
  make
  ```

### Build unit tests (optional)
In order to build unit tests, you have to enable the option BUILD_UNIT_TESTS (default to ON) and to provide GTest package through CMake find_package mechanism. You also need gcovr to enable coverage report generation (COVERAGE option).
Note: you can easily provide GTest via conan package manager:
  1. Install conan and setup PATH variable (more information on https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  ```
  pip install conan
  pip install gcovr
  export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
  ```
  2. Install GTest in your build folder:
  ```
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  conan install ../conan/conanfile.txt -of=./ -pr ../conan/profile_linux_x86_64.txt --build=missing -s build_type=Debug
  ```
  Beware `-s build_type` must be consistent with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` otherwise gtest will not be found.

  3. Configure the project (can be done on an already configured project)
  ```
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ```

### Simulator
To start a network simulator, you can either create a virtual ethernet pair (on Linux you can use the helper script 'create_virtual_ethernet.sh') or use a real network interface by using two computer or two interfaces on the same computer.
Note: the simulator has to be started first


## Slave stack
A simple slave stack is under development. A working example based on Nuttx RTOS and tested on arduino due + easycat Lan9252 shield is available in `examples/slave/nuttx_lan9252`. Follow the readme in `boards/arduino_due` for insight about how to setup and build the slave stack.

### Current state:

- Can go from INIT to PRE-OP to SAFE-OP to OP with proper verification for each transition.
- Can read and write PI
- Supports ESC Lan9252 through SPI.
- Tools available to flash/dump eeprom from ESC.


### TODO

- Test coverage
- Integrate slave stack in the simulation
- Cover all the ESM state transitions (going back from OP to other states)
- Support a second ESC driver (ie: xmc4800)
- Implement mailbox protocols.
- Allow more than 2 PI sync manager. (multipdo)
- DC support.
- Improve error reporting through AL_STATUS and AL_STATUS_CODE

- ci to test the cross compilation build ?


## Release procedure

KickCAT versions follow the rules of semantic versioning https://semver.org/

On major version update, a process of testing starts. The version is in alpha phase until API stabilization. Then we
switch to release candidate (-rcx). To leave a release candidate state, it is required that:

- the software is tested intensivly (at least 5 continuous days - 24*5 hours) without detecting a bug (realtime loss, crash, memory leak...).
- the code coverage is sufficient (80% line and 50% branch) for master/slave stack (tools and simulation can be less).

For each tag, Conan center has to be updated (https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/kickcat).

When a version leaves the release canditate state a github release shall be generated on the corresponding tag.
