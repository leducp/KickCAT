# A simple C++ EtherCAT master/slave stack.

Kick-start your slaves!

Thin EtherCAT stack designed to be embedded in a more complex software and with efficiency in mind.

## Master stack

### Current state:
 - Working state (can go to OP state, read/write P.I., send/receive SDO)
 - interface redundancy is supported
 - CoE: read and write SDO - blocking and async call
 - CoE: Emergency message
 - CoE: SDO Information
 - Bus diagnostic: can reset and get errors counters
 - hook to configure non compliant slaves
 - consecutives writes to reduce latency - up to 255 datagrams in flight
 - Support EtherCAT mailbox gateway (ETG.8200)
 - build for Linux, Windows and PikeOS

**NOTE** The current implementation is designed for little endian host only!

### TODO:
 - CoE: segmented transfer - partial implementation
 - CoE: diagnosis message - 0x10F3
 - Bus diagnostic: auto discover broken wire (on top of error counters)
 - More profiles: FoE, EoE, AoE, SoE
 - Distributed clock
 - AF_XDP Linux socket to improve performance
 - Addressing groups (a.k.a. multi-PDO)

### Operatings systems:
#### Linux
To improve latency on Linux, you have to
 - use Linux RT (PREMPT_RT patches),
 - set a real time scheduler for the program (i.e. with chrt)
 - disable NIC IRQ coalescing (with ethtool)
 - disable RT throttling
 - isolate ethercat task and network IRQ on a dedicated core
 - change network IRQ priority

#### PikeOS
 - Tested on PikeOS 5.1 for native personnality (p4ext)
 - You have to provide the CMake cross-toolchain file which shall define PIKEOS variable (or adapt the main CMakelists.txt to your needs)
 - examples are provided with a working but non-optimal process/thread configuration (examples/PikeOS/p4ext_config.c): feel free to adapt it to your needs

#### Windows
Absolutely NOT suitable for real time use, but it can come in handy to run tools that rely on EtherCAT communication.

To build the library, you need to install:
- conan for windows (tested with 2.9.1)
- gcc for Windows (tested with w64devkit 2.0.0)
- npcap (tested with driver 1.80 + SDK 1.70 through conan package)


### Build:
KickCAT project is handled through CMake. To build the project, call CMake to configure it and then the build tool (default on Linux is make):
  1. Create the build folder
  ```
  mkdir -P build
  ```
  2. Install conan and the dependencies with it (you may need to adapt the profile to suit your current installation). This step is mandatory for Windows, optional otherwise
  ```
  python3 -m venv kickcat_venv
  source kickcat_venv/bin/activate
  pip install conan
  conan install conan/conanfile_linux.txt -of=build/ -pr:h conan/profile_linux_x86_64.txt -pr:b conan/profile_linux_x86_64.txt --build=missing -s build_type=Release
  ```
  2. Configure the project (more information on https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/)
  ```
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ```
  3. Build the project
  ```
  make
  ```

### Build unit tests (optional)
In order to build unit tests, you have to enable the option BUILD_UNIT_TESTS (default to ON) and to provide GTest package through CMake find_package mechanism. You also need gcovr to enable coverage report generation (COVERAGE option).
Note: you can easily provide GTest via conan package manager:
  1. Install conan and setup PATH variable (more information on https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  ```
  python3 -m venv kickcat_venv
  source kickcat_venv/bin/activate
  pip install gcovr
  ```
  2. Install GTest in your build folder:
  ```
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  conan install ../conan/conanfile.txt -of=./ -pr ../conan/profile_linux_x86_64.txt -pr:b ../conan/profile_linux_x86_64.txt --build=missing -s build_type=Debug
  ```
  Beware `-s build_type` must be consistent with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` otherwise gtest will not be found.

  3. Configure the project (can be done on an already configured project)
  ```
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  ```

## Slave stack

### Current state:

- Can go from INIT to PRE-OP to SAFE-OP to OP with proper verification for each transition.
- Can read and write PI
- Supports ESC Lan9252 through SPI.
- Supports XMC4800 ESC (with NuttX RTOS). Pass the CTT at home tests.
- Tools available to flash/dump eeprom from ESC.
- CoE: Object dictionnary
- CoE: SDO support

### TODO

- Test coverage
- Support more mailbox protocols (SDO Information, FoE, EoE)
- Allow more than 2 PI sync manager. (multi-PDO)
- DC support.
- Improve error reporting through AL_STATUS and AL_STATUS_CODE (For now it only reports the errors regarding state machine transitions.)

### Examples
A working example based on Nuttx RTOS and tested on arduino due + easycat Lan9252 shield is available in `examples/slave/nuttx_lan9252`.
Another example using the XMC4800 with NuttX is available.
Follow the readme in `KickCAT/examples/slave/nuttx/xmc4800/README.md` for insight about how to setup and build the slave stack.

## Simulator
It is possible tu run a virtual network with the provided emulated ESC implementation.
To start a network simulator, you can either create a virtual ethernet pair (on Linux you can use the helper script 'create_virtual_ethernet.sh') or use a real network interface by using two computer or two interfaces on the same computer.
**Note:** the simulator has to be started first

### Current state:
 * Load eeprom
 * Emulate basic sync manager behavior
 * Emulate basic FFMU behavior

### TODO
 * Support interrupt (update the right register depending on the accesses on other one and the interrupt configuration)
 * Support redundancy behavior

## Release procedure

KickCAT versions follow the rules of semantic versioning https://semver.org/

On major version update, a process of testing starts. The version is in alpha phase until API stabilization. Then we
switch to release candidate (-rcx). To leave a release candidate state, it is required that:

- the software is tested intensivly (at least 5 continuous days - 24*5 hours) without detecting a bug (realtime loss, crash, memory leak...).
- the code coverage is sufficient (80% line and 50% branch) for master/slave stack (tools and simulation can be less).

For each tag, Conan center has to be updated (https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/kickcat).

When a version leaves the release canditate state a github release shall be generated on the corresponding tag.

### Update Conan Recipe on conan center
Kickcat is available on **conan-io**. Whenever there is a new tag which is consider sufficiently stable:
1. Create a new PR on https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index
2. Follow PR: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pull/19482 to add new versions to the recipe
